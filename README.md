# Testing React Router DOM and Context API

- I deployed one of my project in react in which I used Routes and Context API and that project is not working properly so I am making this simple site to test Routes and Context API whether it works properly on Vercel or not.
- Till now I found out thst it is working properly and there are any other issues in my project that I'am finding.
